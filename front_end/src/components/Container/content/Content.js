                        <p>In Japan today, the child guidance offices cannot keep up with the continuing increase in child abuse.
                        There are not enough group homes and foster families to take in the abused children. While some children
                        go unnoticed in their homes and are not even put under temporary protection, 45,000 others who cannot live
                        with their parents due to reasons such as abuse, parental illness, and/or parental imprisonment live in
                        group homes or with foster families. When these children turn 18 years old, they must leave their foster
                        placements (“nests”) and stand on their own two feet.</p>

                        <p>In most families, the parents (“parent birds”) teach their children (“chicks”) how to “fly” and “feed
                            themselves” before sending them off on their own. However, foster children who cannot depend on their
                            parents must leave their “nests” when they turn 18 without proper preparation or practice. In addition,
                            they are no longer eligible to receive governmental assistance. Financial problems, small stumbles at
                            work, loneliness, anxiety… When faced with these issues, many children struggle alone, keeping their
                            thoughts bottled up inside. Unable to confide in anyone, they often find themselves in deeper trouble.
                            Once these children leave their foster placements, they lose their “nests” to return to for temporary
                            comfort when they become ill or lose their jobs.</p>

                        <p class="txt">This is Bridge for Smile’s flagship program for high school seniors facing independence in
                            the immediate future. It is a series of 6 seminars, 1 seminar every month for 6 months. Bridge for Smile
                            has been running this program ever since its establishment. Same-aged youths from various group homes
                            gather for this seminar together with almost an equal number of adult volunteers to support them. They
                            gain knowledge and skills necessary to live on their own including how to move houses, keep track of
                            finances, and protect themselves from danger. The youths also learn how to build relationships with
                            people they meet for the first time. These seminars serve as a place for the youths to find fellow peers
                            with whom they can confide in after “leaving their nests.”</p>

                        <p class="txt">This is a program where youths go “into the field” for a few days as interns and learn
                            about a job firsthand. Together with Bridge for Smile’s contact at the internship company, the youths’
                            group home staff, and Bridge for Smile staff, the youths set their goals before the internship and
                            review their experiences afterwards. This program not only nurtures perspectives on working but also
                            gives the youths confidence that they have been “trusted” and “recognized,” leading to growth.</p>
